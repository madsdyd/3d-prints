# Bass Shelf Holder

This is a bass guitar - or guitar - holder that mounts on a shelf. Convenient if you lack space, and have a number of shelfs you can actually mount stuff on. Especially if the shelves contain stuff you don't use all the time. :-)

# Instructions

You need to split the model in your slicer into the holder and the screw.

I had success printing in PLA 0.3 mm, using infill of 25%. It need to be quite strong to be able to carry a bass guitar, that is somewhat heavy.

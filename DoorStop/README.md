# Replacement doorstop

This is a replacement door stop for 25 mm/1" wall mounted door stops.

You probably want to print this in some sort of soft/flexible material.

# Instructions

Designed to print standing up with no support. 0.3mm layer height 15% PLA was fine for me, but too hard for my doors, still waiting to get some flexible material to print with.

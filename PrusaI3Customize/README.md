# Stuff for Prusa I3 (Hephestos)

Various minor additions/modifications to the Prusa I3 printer.

- longer-support-filament-holder : The holder that comes with the printer has a 80 mm width, but my filament is 95 mm. This is 100mm, scale the z value to match yours.
- filament-guide : Designed to guide the filament, so it does not track away from the spool. The cup is for holding a sponge or similar to remove dust particles from the filament while it is feed into the extruder.

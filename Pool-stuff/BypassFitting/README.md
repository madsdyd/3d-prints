# Bypass Fitting for Pool hose (32 mm)

This is a fitting to allow one to connect a standard
(European/British) hose connector to e.g. the hose from your pump to
the pool, to draw water to e.g. a water slide, water heater or similar.

# Instructions

Print vertical, use lots of fill. Seems to work well for me using 0.3
mm pla.

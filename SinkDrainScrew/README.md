# Sink drain screw

I have no idea what this is called in neither danish nor english.

I made this for a friend, which lives in a house built by Sweders, with "swedish" sinkgs. For this type of sink, the drain plug is "connected" to a lever, that allows you to raise and lower the drain plug without getting your finges into the water, which is very convenient. However, the plastic part that works as the connection was broken on one of his sinks, and this is a replacement.

# Instructions

You need to print it pretty solid to work, otherwise it will snap. Also, if it is *very* tight in the thread, try reducing the size when slicing, or reduce the thread radius in the SCAD file.

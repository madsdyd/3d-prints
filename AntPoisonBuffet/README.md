# Ant Poison Buffet

Ants are a pest sometimes. This is a replacement part for an ant poison buffet that is marketed in Denmark as [ECOstyle myrefri genopfyldelig lokked√•se](http://ecostyle.dk/MyreFri-genopfyldelige-lokkedaase). The active stuff seems to be Loxiran, and is also marketed, under other names, in other countries.

It works well, but the lower parts have a tendency to leak after some use. This is a replacement part. The smart thing is that you can place them over the trails the ants have already made.

# Instructions

Worked well when printed in PLA.

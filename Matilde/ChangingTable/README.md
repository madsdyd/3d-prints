# Sylvanian Changing Table

This is a small table designed to be used when Sylvanian parents need to change a diaper on their Sylvanian babies.

Designed by my 10 year old daughter. A very simple table, but apparently well suited for the Sylvanian parents.

I think Sylvanian is about 1:16, but this was made to fit working heigth. It may also double as a couch/coffee table.

If you should happen to make one, my daughter would love to hear about it :-).

# Sylvanian Trailer Mount

This is a trailer mount for a Sylvanian car with trailer. My daughter
broke it, and I was not able to glue it (no clue seemed to want to
bond for longer periods), so I designed this replacement part.

The set is here:

I printed this pretty coarse in PLA, and it works well. 

I spent a long time getting the ball bearing to fit "good enough",
while not breaking. If you print in ABS or another material, you may
have to test print the ball bearing a few times, and fiddle a bit with
the various material widths.

Designed in FreeCAD, September 2014.

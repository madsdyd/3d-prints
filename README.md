# Various projects for 3D printing.

This is where I store my (small) 3d printing projects.

I have tested them all on my own 3d printer, a Prusa I3 Hephestos. Unless otherwise noted, I have made all models from scratch.

## Formats

Fcstd files can be read and edited with [FreeCAD](http://freecadweb.org/) , scad files are [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) files, and blend files are, of course, files from the  [Blender](http://www.blender.org/) application.

# Various Stuff for Pools

For now: two very simple hose adapters, 32mm-32mm and 32mm-42mm.
(32mm ≃ 1 1/4", 42 mm ≃ 1 2/3 ")

Not at lot to say, really, just convenient, when you need to connect some hoses together. 

The 32 are typical in and outtake hoses, the 42 mm is used for some skimmers, and it is convenient for me when connecting my pool cleaner to connect it to the skimmer hose.

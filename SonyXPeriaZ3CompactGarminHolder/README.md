# Carholder for Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Mobile Phone

This is a holder for a Sony Xperia Z3 Compact Mobile Phone, that fits onto a Garmin holder. The diameter for the ball is about 17 mm, and this holder will fit onto one such.

If you are into SCAD files, the file is pretty easy to edit, with lots of constants in the start. The part that goes onto the ball is pretty standalone, and could possibly be used for other purposes.

The fit for the phone is may slightly to tight. Will have to wait and see how it works longterm.

# Instructions

I printed it as is, with 15% line support in cura, 0.3 mm layer height. It is pretty strong in the holder, but semi-fragile in the part that goes onto the ball. You may have to experiment with this, to get a good fit, where you wont loose tabs.

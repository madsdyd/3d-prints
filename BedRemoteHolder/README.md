# Remote holder for bed

This is a holder for a remote, that can hang on the edge of my bed. I have printed it to have a loose fit for a rather large Sony remote, but it will fit other remotes, I reckon.

There are many other remote holders, but most are meant to be mounted on walls, or similar, while this one can hang on the edge of your bed.

It can hold a remote up to approximately 55 mm (~2") in width, 30 mm (~1.25") thick, and about 250 mm (~10") high. The mount will fit bed walls up to 24 mm (~1").

The source file is a FreeCAD file.

# Instructions

You will need to enable support for the hook to print properly. 0.3mm layer height 15% PLA was fine for me.

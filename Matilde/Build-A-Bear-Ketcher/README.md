# Build-a-Bear Ketcher  

This is a crude ketcher for Build-a-Bears.

My daughter had one ketcher, but obviously lacked one more for two build a bears to be able to play together.

The mode is quite crude, but I was in a hurry, and my daughter seemed to like it anyway.

You can use some tape to make a better handle, if you like.

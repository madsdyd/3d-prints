# Toothbrush Head Holder

This is a holder for toothbrush heads from the Braun Oral-B(r) toothbrush.

The ones that comes with the toothbrush, gets very dirty, and it is some work to keep it clean. This one goes inside a glass and is a lot easier to clean, and the brush heads dry faster.

# Instructions

These models are somewhat tricky to print nice. It does not have a lot of contact with the bed, and there are a lot of non-straight lines in them. You will probably want to use a brim, and perhaps 0.2 mm layer height. Less, if you can make it.

# Siemens Washing Machine Pump Compartment Opener

This is a "tool" to open a siemens washing machine pump house thingy.

If it is stuck with grit, it becomes very hard to open. If you use a normal hand tool, there is a good chance you will ruin the handle on the open thingy. By using this, you avoid that.

# Instructions

You need to print it pretty solid to work, otherwise this key will snap. I used 1.6 wall thickness and 20% fill rate, 0.2 mm layer height.

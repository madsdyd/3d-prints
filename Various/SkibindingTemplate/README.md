# Template for moving the front binding of a ski

This is a parametric template for moving the front binding on an Rossignol ski.

The big holes are meant for mounting in the existing holes. The smaller holes are then used for marking the new holes that needs drilling.

Normally a specialized tool is used for this, but this is an easy and relatively stable/correct way to make the new drillholes using this template and e.g. a bench drill.

Remember to not drill deeper than the existing holes though ;-).

And, use some plasticfriendly glue to mount the screws - just a tiny pad.

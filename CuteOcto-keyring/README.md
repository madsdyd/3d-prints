# Cute Octo Says Hello Keyring

This is the Cute Octo Says Hello, with a torus on top, to print and put in a keyring. (Remixed from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:27053)

I have printed several of these for my kids and their friends. 

They love it in colors that glow in the dark or are very bright.

They tend to show it to their friends, and parents, thereby spreading the happy message of 3d printing in all homes :-).

# Instructions

I recommend scaling this to Z height of 25 mm (1") in your slicer, then print very fine to get a smooth finish.
I had to edit this in blender, and I could not figure out how to set the z size to 25 mm. Perhaps I will try freecad next time.

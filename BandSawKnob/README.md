# Replacement knob for Einhell BT-SB 200 bandsaw

This is a replacement knob for the Einhell BT-SB 200 bandsaw (see e.g. [Amazon]( http://www.amazon.co.uk/Einhell-Blue-BT-SB-200-Band/dp/B001EX6QAK/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_top). 

This is quite a cheap bandsaw, but suitable for a small hobby wood shop. I broke the knob that raises and lowers the guide, but was able to design and print this replacement. It works very well, and is quite a bit stronger than the original!

Attribution: I actually remixed this from a ["generic" knob thing on thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:420386), but had to modify the scad file to allow for double cuts in the axis, and going "through" to allow the spring loading from the other side.

# Instructions

Pretty simple print, 0.3 layer, 15% infill PLA was strong enough for me.

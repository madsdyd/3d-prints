# Toothbrush Head Holder

This is a holder/stand for toothbrush heads from the Braun Oral-B(r) toothbrush.

The head holders that often comes with the toothbrush, gets very dirty, and it is some work to keep it clean. 

This head holder/stand goes inside a cup or glass and is a lot easier to clean, and the brush heads dry faster. There are cuts in the bottom to allow water to drip out (and into the bottom of the cup, where it will evaporate from a potentially much larger surface). There is a slot so you can see the color rings used to tell heads apart, and there is a holder that will grab the side of the cup. 

It is designed to work in a cup with diameter approx 100 mm, but it works well in classes down to 70-80 mm too. (Thats about 3-4" I think).

# Instructions

The models (dual and single) are somewhat tricky to print nice. They do not have a lot of contact with the bed, and there are a lot of non-straight lines in them. You will probably want to use a brim, and perhaps 0.2 mm layer height. Less, if you can make it.

I am quite interessted in feedback from people that tries to print this model, as I might try to redesign it to be easier to print.

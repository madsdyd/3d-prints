# Velux DKL curtain wiretrack replacement part

This is a replacement for part of the wiretrack of a Velux curtain.

I think the curtain may be called DKL 05 AI 12X, but I am not sure. 

In Denmark Velux windows are pretty common, and lots of people may have a curtain like this. The design of the curtain wiretrack makes it wear the original parts out pretty fast. I have had to change the wires twice in 10 years, and now had to change the guides, as the wear made them wear the wires as well. Its bad design, but at least you can now print a replacement! 

Also, if you have such a curtain, you may want to check out the replacement for the [spring holder of the wiretrack, by cylgom](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:557268).

# Instructions

I recommend printing as the model is layed out, as that means the visible side gets the smoothest surface. The models has both a left and a right side - you obviusly only need to print the one you need. (You slicer should be able to delete one of the parts for you).

Printed in 0.2mm layer height, solid, worked well for me. It uses about 8 gram of material, and gets quite robust.

If you life in a hot country, you may want to print in ABS, as PLA may get to hot.

This is a very small thing, with a number of details, so you may need to file a bit afterwards, or adjust the hole for the screw, to make it fit perfectly.
